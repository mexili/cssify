# CSSify

Tired of using Bootstrap/Bulma, but don't want to scaffold a whole bunch of CSS on your own? CSSify to the rescue - make your own CSS framework!

Using CSS frameworks always come with a trade-off - you need to choose between a steep learning curve, limited feature sets, and large file sizes. While preprocessors like Sass improved modularity, overcoming all three obstacles at once seems to be a challenge. That is, until now.

Inspiration of this project has been taken from https://modernizr.com/download for customizing it for the stylesheet. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Features

1. Select global color palette
2. Customize your CSS class
3. Set custom layout structure
4. Minified CSS
5. Responsive
6. **Actively under development**

### Why CSSify?

CSSify provides a solution to all these problems, by offering a rock solid base which is customisable in all it's aspects. Common tasks such as defining layouts, brand colors, spacing utilities, breakpoints, typography, etc can now be completed with a few clicks with a live preview- enormously boosting your creative speed.
